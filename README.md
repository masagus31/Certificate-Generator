# bulk-certificate-generator

Generate many certificates based on list of names. Currently the generator can only place the text (name) in the center with an offset on the y (vertical) axis.

## Getting Started

This generator uses [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) library to generate many certificates so install it first before using the script.

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

Put list of names in `name_list.txt` then run the script.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Configuration

See `config.cfg` (self-explanatory).
